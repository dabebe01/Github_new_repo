# Github_new_repo
applying repository for the second time
The name and the description of the repository appear at the top. Next, you would see a list of the files and folders that are in the repository. Finally, you would see what is in the README file.
Since the README file is the first thing users see when they land on your repository, it is good practice to populate it with useful information to users. Using the pencil icon on the right, you can edit the README file and include, for example, a detailed description of the repository. You can also add special instructions or prerequisites to use the repository, and perhaps some examples of how to use the repository.
